# SQL-project
The SQL queries analyze employee trends, covering department counts, gender distribution, average age, common roles, job satisfaction, and attrition. Insights include employee counts by department and gender, age-based satisfaction, and attrition rates.

# Total Employees by Department: 
The first query calculates the total number of employees in each department by grouping data based on the department field. This provides an overview of department sizes, useful for understanding workforce distribution.

# Employees by Gender within Departments: 
This query goes further by counting the number of male and female employees in each department. Using conditional aggregation, it separately tallies male and female employees, allowing HR to analyze gender representation across departments.

# Average Age by Department: 
This query calculates the average age of employees in each department. Grouping by department and averaging the age column helps identify departments with younger or older workforce demographics, which may have implications for training and succession planning.

# Most Common Job Roles in Departments: 
Here, the query identifies job roles that are most common within each department. By counting each job role and ordering by frequency, HR can see the distribution of roles, which may reveal specialized areas or highlight heavily staffed roles.

# Average Job Satisfaction by Education Level: 
This query calculates the average job satisfaction score for each level of education. It helps analyze whether certain educational backgrounds correlate with higher satisfaction, which may inform hiring or training policies.

# Average Age by Job Satisfaction Level: 
By calculating the average age of employees for each job satisfaction level, this query explores whether age affects job satisfaction. It may reveal trends like higher satisfaction among certain age groups, aiding in age-targeted retention strategies.

# Attrition Rate by Age Band: 
This query calculates the attrition rate for each age band by counting employees who left the company (attrition = ‘Yes’) relative to total employees. This identifies age groups with higher turnover, helping HR focus on retention efforts for those at higher risk of leaving.

# Education Level with Highest Job Satisfaction Among Frequent Travelers: 
This query finds the education levels with the highest job satisfaction among employees who travel frequently. It provides insights into which educational backgrounds might adapt better to travel-heavy roles.

# Age Band with Highest Job Satisfaction Among Married Employees: 
The final query identifies the age band with the highest average job satisfaction among married employees. This can reveal insights into job satisfaction levels for a specific demographic and aid in tailoring retention strategies for married employees.
